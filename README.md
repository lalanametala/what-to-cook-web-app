HTML, CSS, and JavaScript group project developed by [La√≠s Namatela](https://www.linkedin.com/in/la%C3%ADs-nametala/), [Raphael Martins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphaelameidamartins/), [Rafael Oliveira Elias](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafael-oliveira-elias-865bb3154/) and [Wendryo Sales](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wendryosales/) at the end of [Principles of Web Development Module](https://github.com/raphaelalmeidamartins/trybe_exercicios/tree/main/1_fundamentos-do-desv-web) of Trybe's Web Development course.

We developed a random recipe suggestions web app fetching for recipes data from the Edman's API. We also implemented a chat-bot to set user preferences.
